<a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rutuspatel/retail-analysis-with-walmart-sales-data/data">
 Kaggle Dataset
</a>

<br>
<p> The Walmart Sales dataset is composed of historical data across different store locations from the time 2010-2012. It contains a comprehensive view of retail sales performance, including information on various store locations, sales figures, promotional events, and economic factors. This EDA aims to uncover insights and trends within the dataset to better understand customer behavior, sales patterns, and seasonal effects.</p>
<br>
<p>Jupyter Notebook was used to visualize outputs of live code and oragnize sections of analysis. Python was used in this analysis along with the libraries: SciPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Six aspects were analyzed in the EDA:
<ol>
 <li>Which store has maximum sales</li>
  <br>
 <li>Which store has maximum standard deviation, and the respective coefficient of mean to standard deviation</li>
  <br>
 <li>Which stores had good quarterly growth rate in Q3’2012</li>
  <br>
 <li>Holidays that had higher sales than the mean sales in non-holiday season for all stores together</li>
  <br>
 <li>A monthly view of sales</li>
  <br>
 <li>Statistical Model</li>
 <ul>For Store 1 – Linear Regression models for CPI, Unemployment, Temperature, and Fuel price against Sales.</ul> </p>
</ol>
